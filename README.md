# Worldtrip

This is a simple project with the intent to learn responsive front-end development concepts using Chakra UI.

Worldtrip is a tourism/travel website containing simple information about continents and cities. The layout design was provided by Rocketseat and this project is used to practice and expand on the knowledge provided by their NextJS classes.

As said before, it is a very simple application consisting of responsive interface for mobile and desktop devices, and a mock API generated using json-server through the file ```db.json```.

## Usage

```javascript
json-server --watch db.json --port 3004 //starts the mock api in http://localhost:3004

yarn dev //runs the nextJS front-end
```
